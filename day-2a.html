  <h1>Input from user</h1>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Here we have a message using the data that the user input into the prompt.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let userName;
      userName = prompt("What is your name?");

      document.write(`Hi ${userName}, nice to meet you!`);
    </script>
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2> You Try It!</h2>
    <p>Write a message using the dog's name.</p>
    <p>
      <script>
        let dogName;
        dogName = prompt("What is the name of your dog?");
        // Try it! Write a message about the dog's name!
        document.write();
      </script>
    </p>
  </section>
  <h2>You Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now write a message using both the dog's name and the user's name from above. Note: You don't have to ask the user
    again. The variables have already been assinged in the above section. </p>
  <p>

    <script>
      // Try it! Write a message using both variables: userName and dogsName, from above.
      document.write();
    </script>
  </p>
